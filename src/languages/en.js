                  energy inside your manufacturing facilities using solar power,
                  renewable raw materials, digital passports for plastic

                  The use of alternative energy sources, like solar, wind, or

                  not only decrease carbon emissions but also reduce energy

                the next edition of the event, ACHEMA 2024. One of the main
                themes of ACHEMA 2024 is likely to be the continued focus on
                sustainability and digitalization. As the world becomes
                increasingly conscious of the need to reduce its environmental
                impact and embrace new technologies, the chemical and process
                industries will be at the forefront of this transformation.

        "In the 1920s, treating diabetes required the sacrifice of over 50 animals just to supply enough insulin for the yearly treatment of a single patient. From this labor-intensive process to todayâ€™s cutting-edge biotechnology, insulin production has come a long way.",
      content: {
        title: "Insulin: A Manufacturing Evolution",
        text1: `
          In 1922, insulin was used for the first time in patients, marking the beginning of a medical revolution.
          Initially extracted from pig pancreases, the process was labor-intensive, requiring over 50 animals to
          produce enough insulin to treat one person for a single year.<br><br>
          Dr. Frederick Banting and his assistant, Charles Best, at the University of Toronto, were the first to use
          insulin in a human patient. After their groundbreaking discovery, Banting and Best sold the patent rights
          to the University of Toronto, which subsequently licensed them to the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in
          1923, enabling mass production of insulin.<br><br>
          Fast forward to today, insulin production has become a landmark achievement in biotechnology. Instead
          of relying on animal pancreas, human insulin is now produced using recombinant DNA technology. The
          gene for human proinsulin is inserted into E. coli bacteria or yeast, where it is expressed, purified, and
          processed to remove the C-peptide, resulting in active insulin.<br><br>
          This advancement has significantly improved the efficiency, sustainability, and scalability of insulin
          production, ensuring access to essential treatment for populations worldwide.<br><br>

        sub_title2: "Two-Chain Manufacturing (1970s-1980s)",
        text2: `
          The first recombinant DNA method for producing insulin used a two-chain approach. DNA sequences for
          the A and B chains of human insulin were separately synthesized and inserted into bacteria (E. coli) or
          yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). When expressed, the A and B chains form insoluble aggregates
          called inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies are often tagged with bacterial proteins to aid in solubility
          and purification.<br><br>
          After expression, the host cells are harvested by centrifugation and then lysed using chemical or
          mechanical methods to release the inclusion bodies and recombinant insulin. The inclusion bodies are
          purified through centrifugation and chromatography, based on the tag or solubility.<br><br>
          This process had two major challenges, it was complex and labor-intensive, and yields were relatively
          low, making scalability difficult for growing global demand.<br><br>

          The introduction of the proinsulin-based one-chain method revolutionized insulin production, offering a
simpler and more scalable approach.<br><br>
A single gene encoding human proinsulin, a precursor that includes both the A and B chains connected
by a C-peptide, was synthesized. The proinsulin gene was inserted into E. coli or yeast, where host cells
expressed proinsulin as a single-chain polypeptide.<br><br>
Proinsulin was then isolated and purified directly from the host organisms. Finally, enzymes like trypsin
and carboxypeptidase cleaved the C-peptide, leaving the active insulin molecule.<br><br>

Some of the advantages include:

              oversee the slightest detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Adaptability and agility</b> represent other crucial common
              grounds between volleyball and engineering. In the dynamic
              environment of a volleyball game, players must constantly adjust
              their strategies to counter their opponents and overcome
              unforeseen obstacles. This ability to adapt under pressure
              resonates strongly with engineers, who must think fast and
              creatively to develop innovative solutions.

            `,
        text4: `
                <p>
          Also, both volleyball and engineering celebrate the pursuit of
          excellence through <b>discipline and continuous improvement</b>. In
          volleyball, athletes tirelessly train to enhance their skills,
          technique, and physical abilities to perform at the highest level.
          Similarly, engineers constantly seek to push the boundaries of
          innovation, refining existing technologies and exploring new frontiers
          to improve the world for the coming generations.
        </p>
