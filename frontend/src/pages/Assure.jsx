              <h3>Rethinking Post-Commissioning Responsibility</h3>
              <p>
                In plant design and engineering, project involvement has
                traditionally concluded at the point of commissioning. Once the
                operational handover is complete, the original project teams
                often step away, leaving clients to manage any subsequent
                complexities internally.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Helmchron, we believe this conventional approach no longer
                meets the demands of modern, high-performance operations, nor
                does it reflect the principles of strategic partnership and
                unified teamwork. As a response, we have developed Helmchron
                Assure.
              </p>
